# BlockChain

## This is my blockchain demo project

This blockchain includes mining to create new blocks, checking the correctness of the chain as well as sending rewards to users for mining a new block.

## How to run 

```
git clone https://github.com/dinhminhx/BlockChain.git
npm i
```
We can do
```
tsc -w index
```
On another terminal 

```
npm run watch
```
or 
```
node index.js
```
